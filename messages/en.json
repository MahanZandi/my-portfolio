        "description": "I'm Mahan Zandi, a Front-end Developer passionate about building modern, clean, and fully responsive user interfaces. Since I started coding, I've been deeply interested in creating professional user experiences using React.js, Next.js, TailwindCSS, and other modern technologies. My experience goes beyond learning and practicing â€” I've worked on real-world projects like the official website for Faravardeh Arya Factory (fdarya.com). Over the course of three months, I designed, developed, and deployed the entire project from scratch, focusing on Clean Code, SEO optimization, and responsive design to create a modern and effective website that helped boost the company's marketing and sales efforts. In addition to client projects, Iâ€™m building my personal portfolio website to showcase my work, skills, and professional journey. In every project, I aim to implement professional designs and deliver a polished, user-centered product â€” even when Iâ€™m not the designer myself. I'm constantly learning and growing. Whether it's reading official documentation, following YouTube tutorials, working on real projects, or solving problems through research, I stay updated with the latest frontend trends and technologies. ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to become an active and valuable member of a professional team, whether on-site or remote. I genuinely enjoy creating, learning new things, overcoming challenges, and continuously improving my skills."
